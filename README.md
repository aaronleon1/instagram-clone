### When posting as a test
  
Currently a user cannot delete their posts, so upload a work-safe image (dog and cat themed currently) and it will be deleted within the day. Database is checked frequently and I am working on the best way to keep a user from deleting all posts as opposed to just their own.
Feel free to keep your information private and just use test/dummy credentials.

### Known Issues

- Users can currently sign up without a username. Must introduce form validation for compliance with all database requirements.

### Current Focus
- Sign-up form validation
- Working to implement likes and user-specific post deletion
- Further styling on for image uploader when logged out
