### When posting as a test
  
Currently a user cannot delete their posts, so upload a work-safe image (dog and cat themed currently) and it will be deleted within the day. Database is checked frequently.
Feel free to keep your information private and just use credentials like: Username: testuser101 and email: testuser101@gmail.com. Any variation will work.

### Known Issues

- Users can currently sign up without a username. Must introduce form validation for compliance with all database requirements.

### Current Focus
- Sign-up form validation
- Working to implement likes and user-specific post deletion
- Further styling on for image uploader when logged out
